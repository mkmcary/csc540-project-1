# How To Run The Program
Prior to running the program, please run the files `setup.sql` and `data.sql` on your database.  This can be done as follows:
```
SQL> @setup.sql

SQL> @data.sql
```

We created an executable JAR file to run our project.  Run it as follows from a command line interface:
```
java -jar Project1_Team6.jar <username> <password>
```

The values for `<username>` and `<password>` should be your oracle login credentials to be able to access the database.  From here, you should be able to fully work with the application.
